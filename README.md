## Building the Application

To build the application, follow these steps:

1.  **Create a build directory and navigate to it:**
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```
2.  **Run CMake to configure the project:**
    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```
1.  **Build the project:** While still inside the `build` directory, execute the build command.
    ```bash
    cmake --build .
    ```
    This will compile the source code and create the executable.
